# leetcode_windows11_november2022
github repo for collecting mine (&amp; others if i struggle to solve them or find any that shine) solutions to leetcode problems mostly in python for now. This repo 
is created using the LeetHub Chrome extension so whenever I submit a correct answer on leetcode it collects my solutions here. I named this repo "windows 11" because every time I switch computers, etc., I have to use a different repo or start a new repo.
